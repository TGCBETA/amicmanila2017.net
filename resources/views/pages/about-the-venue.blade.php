		<p>Miriam (formerly Maryknoll) College is a non-profit, non-stock Catholic educational institution that has offered programs for young women at the basic, tertiary, post-graduate and adult education levels for more than 85 years. The institution also supports specialized centers engaged in curriculum development, research, community outreach and advocacy in the fields of social development, peace education, environmental studies and women’s empowerment. Together, these academic courses and special centers work in harmony to realize Miriam College’s vision as a premier educational institution in the Philippines.</p>
		<p>Miriam College has molded many generations of students in the tradition of academic excellence and service to God, the community and nation. We are proud of having developed competent, well-rounded, principled individuals who possess a clear understanding of the socio-political issues of the times, who are motivated to participate in nation-building, and provided with a solid cultural foundation. It is in this context that Miriam College seeks to find its niche in the formation of Women Leaders in Service.</p>
