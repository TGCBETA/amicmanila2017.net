		<p>The ancient continent of Asia, the cradle of civilization, was also the birth place of mass communication. But in one of those ironic twists of history, the West became the foster parent of this Asian child, nurtured him, and brought him back as a young man to help in the Western conquest of his homeland.</p>
		<p>The first tools for mass communication—pen, paper and printing—were invented in China. Woodblock printing was invented as early as 593 A.D. under the Sui dynasty.</p>
		<p>The ancestor of the Western newspapers, the <i>Ti-Pao</i>, existed in China in handwritten form. As the court bulletin of ancient China it dated back 700 years Before Christ, earlier than Julius Caesar's <i>Acta Diurna</i>, posted in the Roman Forum around 600 A.D. The Koreans invented printing with moveable metal types in 1243 A.D., at least 200 years before John Gutenberg introduced the same thing to Europe in 1425.</p>
		<p>While Asia gave birth to paper and printing, however, it was Europe that developed these inventions to maturity because of the Industrial Revolution. Then followed  the Western colonization of Asia, starting with the Christian missionaries who brought the printing press back to Asia in the 16th century for their religious proselytizing.</p>
		<p>The Western countries came in full force in the 19th century, using military might and mass communication to impose their will—for religious proselytizing, commercial advertising and political propagandizing.</p>
		<p>And today, long after we Asians got our independence from the West in the 1950s, we are still unwitting prisoners of our colonial past. We continue to use Western models of communication in our research, writing, teaching and communicating.</p>
		<p>No doubt it is time to switch paradigms, to "rethink Asian communication in a resurgent Asia." The roots of our communication is in our culture. We need to rediscover our roots, somehow buried under our Asian earth. Let's dig together at the AMIC International Conference Sept. 27-29 in Manila!</p>
