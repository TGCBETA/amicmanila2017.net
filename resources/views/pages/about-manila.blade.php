		<p>Manila is the capital of the Philippines. It is located in the northern island of Luzon close to Quezon City. Quezon City was once the capital, from 1948 to 1976, and is actually the most populous city. Manila is the second most populated city with a population of 1,652,171. It is just under 15 square miles, making it one of the most densely populated cities in the Philippines and in the world. It is where the seat of the Philippine government is located.</p>

		<p>
			<strong>History</strong><br />
			The earliest known records of the city date back to the tenth century. It was known as the Pearl of the Orient because of its location in the Pacific as an important trade route. The city suffered devastating destruction during World War II but has since been rebuilt. It is now the center of education, headquarters to the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific, and attracts more than one million tourists each year.

			<strong>Transportation</strong><br />
			Manila has two international airports and a Light Rail Transit System of 11 different above ground train stations. There are also taxis, motorcycles with sidecars known as tricycles, and the most popular form of transportation known as jeepneys, which are jeep-like public utility vehicles. They have their roots from World War II with the surplus jeeps that were sold to the Philippines who painted them in bright native colors and began using them and producing them for family and tourist transportation.

			<strong>Climate</strong><br />
			The climate in Manila is cooler than other islands due to its more northern location closer to the Equator. Temperatures range from 68 to 100 degrees. The rainy season runs from May through the middle of December, and rains can average from 2 - 19 inches during this time.

		<p>The Philippines is the third largest English speaking country in the world. It has a rich history combining Asian, European, and American influences. Prior to Spanish colonization in 1521, the Filipinos had a rich culture and were trading with the Chinese and the Japanese. Spain's colonization brought about the construction of Intramuros in 1571, a "Walled City" comprised of European buildings and churches, replicated in different parts of the archipelago. In 1898, after 350 years and 300 rebellions, the Filipinos, with leaders like Jose Rizal and Emilio Aguinaldo, succeeded in winning their independence.</p> 
		<p>In 1898, the Philippines became the first and only colony of the United States. Following the Philippine-American War, the United States brought widespread education to the islands. Filipinos fought alongside Americans during World War II, particularly at the famous battle of Bataan and Corregidor which delayed Japanese advance and saved Australia. They then waged a guerilla war against the Japanese from 1941 to 1945. The Philippines regained its independence in 1946.</p>
		<p>Filipinos are a freedom-loving people, having waged two peaceful, bloodless revolutions against what were perceived as corrupt regimes. The Philippines is a vibrant democracy, as evidenced by 12 English national newspapers, 7 national television stations, hundreds of cable TV stations, and 2,000 radio stations.</p>
		<p>Filipinos are a fun-loving people. Throughout the islands, there are fiestas celebrated everyday and foreign guests are always welcome to their homes.</p>
