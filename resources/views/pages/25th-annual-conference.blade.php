		<h4 class="text-center">AMIC Manila 2017 promises to be a cut above the rest</h4>
		<p class="text-center">The 25th AMIC Conference on 27-29 September 2017 will continue to be intellectually stimulating, plus more. </p>
		<p>As in previous conferences, plenary and parallel sessions will feature debates on current and emerging communication and media issues. There will also be discussions on best practices in communication strategies and tools. </p>
		<p>This year's sessions are also envisioned to present innovative and thought-provoking topics – "those which disturb." With the theme, Rethinking Communication in a Resurgent Asia, the conference will encourage paper presenters to question traditional standards and mindsets and come up with pioneering, innovative, creative, and disturbing topics including the so-called "new normal."</p>
		<p>For those who cannot be accommodated in the parallel sessions, poster presentations will be introduced. </p>
		<p>AMIC 2017 also means business. The conference will provide a platform for presenting new ideas, products, and services.  If you have a new publication, you can launch your latest publication during the event. Technology companies may want to present their latest gadgets and apps, and schools may introduce their new academic programs. </p>
		<p>There will be distinct business matching hours during the three-day conference where "sellers meet buyers." </p>
		<p>Many academic institutions are on the lookout for new partners or networks. Thus, AMIC 2017 will facilitate initiation or finalization of memorandum of agreements between new partners.  Before the conference begins, partnership areas among AMIC member-institutions will be publicized to jumpstart dialogue. </p>
		<p>If you feel weary because of the stimulating discussions, join the wellness sessions which will be made available during breaks. These may include massage sessions or even tai chi exercises to reduce stress. </p>
		<p>No event in the Philippines is complete without a karaoke session. Our welcome night will feature the singing talents of our Filipino hosts and foreign delegates. AMIC 2017 will prove that AMIC members Got Talent. </p>
		<p>The Philippine tourism campaign has adopted the slogan, It's more fun in the Philippines.</p>
		<p>AMIC Manila 2017 intends to keep this promise. Enjoy AMIC Manila 2017!</p>

			<p>According to an ancient Chinese <br /> proverb, To forget one’s ancestors is <br /> to be a brook without a source, a tree without root.</p>
			<p>An old Philippine proverb says, Sino <br /> man ang hindi marunong lumingon sa kanyang pinanggalingan, ay hindi makakarating sa kanyang paroroonan. (He who does not think back on his <br /> past, will not arrive at his destination.)</p>
			<p>We invoke this ancient Asian wisdom <br /> to warn, as we lunge headlong into today’s fast-changing world, that non-Asian communication theories, sophisticated gadgets and apps are not the panacea to the world’s problems.<br /> The solutions are in us.</p>
			<p>We in AMIC and in Asia need to rediscover our roots, somehow buried under our feet as we run mindlessly forward. We have imbibed non-Asian ways, and adopted foreign communication theories, <br /> methodologies and practices as we studied abroad, and brought them back to Asia to teach to our young students who would one day become our disciples.</p>
			<p>We preach that communication and culture are inextricably linked. But <br /> have we studied or developed Asian theories of communication based on Asian culture? Very little. <br /> In this coming 2017 AMIC annual conference we suggest that we pause and look back to where we came from.</p>
			<p>We need to rediscover our "Asianess” amidst a resurging Asia. The Asian Development Bank has reported that if Asia continues its current growth trajectory, by 2050 it will regain the dominant economic position it held <br /> some 300 years ago, before the industrial revolution. In this scenario Asia’s gross domestic product (GDP) <br /> will reach $174 trillion (or half of the global GDP) from $17 trillion in 2010.</p>
			<p>A resurging Asia must also be seen in terms of new challenges characterized by inequalities, conflicts, climate change, unsustainable practices, and corruption. Beyond the tools of mass communication, are there distinct Asian communication strategies which can effectively address these challenges that threaten the resurgence of Asia?</p>
			<p>Let us rediscover our Asian past so that we can confidently move into our future. </p>
