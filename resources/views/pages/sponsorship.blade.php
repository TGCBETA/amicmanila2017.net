				<p>AMIC’s annual conference is its flagship program. Its publications are among the most sought-after learning resources by educators, scholars, and practitioners not only in the region but also worldwide. The Asian Journal of Communication (ACJ) is a joint research publication of AMIC and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information of the Nanyang Technological University published by Taylor & Francis Group, a leading international academic publisher. Media Asia is published quarterly and serves as an important platform for information and knowledge exchange, while the Asian Communication Handbook is a factual reference for media and communication indicators and recent media developments in Asian countries.</p>
				<p>The AMIC Asia Communication Award was established in 2006 to recognize outstanding achievements in one or several media and communication fields and categories. The contributions can be focused on a single country within Asia, a region within Asia, or the whole of Asia. The categories are research, education, institution building, and journalism excellence.</p>

				<p><b>SPONSORSHIP CATEGORIES</b></p>
				<p><b>Financing</b></p>
				<p>The AMIC Annual Conference is financed primarily from the participants’ registration fees. To ensure the widest representation of delegates in the communication sector in the Asia Pacific region, the registration fees have been set at a modest amount.</p>
				<p>However, income from registration fees alone will be insufficient to cover the myriad costs of organizing a major international conference. To meet these expenses, AMIC invites corporations and organizations to support and sponsor various conference activities. Sponsorship enables AMIC to waive or reduce conference registration fees for as many delegates especially from developing countries.</p>
				<p>About 400 to 500 participants, not only from Asia Pacific but all over the world, attend this annual event. Your organization will get significant exposure to an interested, relevant, and influential audience. This is an excellent opportunity for your organization to be identified as a key player in this dynamic sector and promote your products and services.</p>
				<p>We are offering a number of sponsorship opportunities in order to provide our sponsors with a high level of visibility with this impressive and intimate group of media and communication leaders from around the world.</p>
				
				<p><b>SPONSORSHIP BENEFITS</b></p>
				<p><b>Publicity and Professional Association with the Conference</b></p>
				<p>The conference will be promoted to more than 10,000 key players in the communication industry in the Asia-Pacific region through mailers, brochures, and tri-media publicity, ensuring wide exposure for sponsors and their identification with the region’s premier communication conference.</p>
				<p><b>Networking with Industry Leaders, Media Practitioners and Academics</b></p>
				<p>During the three-day conference, sponsors can obtain direct access to industry leaders and practitioners in the broadcasting, print, telecommunications, public relations, advertising, media education, and other communication-related sectors. Such networking can generate valuable contacts during and after the event. </p>
				<p><b>Networking with Conference Speakers</b></p>
				<p>More than 100 expert speakers from communication-related companies, government and academe are scheduled to share their views and insights on the conference topics. Their presence will be valuable to sponsors who wish to interact with them. Your representatives can network with key conference delegates to update their knowledge and understanding of your organization and services.</p>
				<p><b>Distribution of Company Profile and Services</b></p>
				<p>The conference kits can include the sponsoring companies’ profiles and services. This is an opportunity for reference guide and a regular reminder of the sponsors’ products or services.</p>
				<p><b>Strengthening your Corporate Image</b></p>
				<p>Through the conference, your company will be projected as an industry player and leader committed to activities that benefit the communication industry.
