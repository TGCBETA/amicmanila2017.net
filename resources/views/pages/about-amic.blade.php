		<h4 class="text-center">AMIC: Shaping a Resurgent Communication Sector<br />
		in the Asia Pacific Region</h4>
		<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
		
		<p>The  Asian  Media  Information  and  Communication  Centre, Inc.  (AMIC) is an  international non-government organization (NGO) mandated to spearhead communication media development in the Asia Pacific region.</p>
		<p>Established in 1971 as a non-profit NGO and a registered charity in Singapore, AMIC promotes  an  ethical  and  socially  responsible  communication  media  sector  committed  to  the tenets of freedom and democracy in a socio-culturally diverse region.</p>
		<p>AMIC transferred its operation to Manila, Philippines in 2015. It was registered anew as a non-stock, non-profit organization at the Philippines' Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
		<p><strong>AMIC's Mission</strong></p>
		<p>Primarily an organization of communication media educators and professionals, AMIC's mission is to nurture and promote communication media research, capacity building, knowledge management and dialogue among academic, industry, government, and civil society.</p>
		<p>AMIC seeks the development and enrichment of communication theories, models, strategies, and practices reflecting distinct Asia-Pacific perspectives, and building on the contributions of Western models and theories.</p>
		<p><strong>AMIC's Vision</strong></p>
		<p>AMIC envisions itself to be the premier Asia-centered policy provider, resource platform, and training institution, for communication media education, research, and professional development. It seeks to provide a platform for and facilitate the development, sharing and exchange of learning resources on communication media within and outside the Asia Pacific region. </p>
		<p>AMIC's key strength is that it has interfaced with civil society and business in facilitating its high-profile events designed to bring together academic scholars, government institutions, development partners, NGOs, and individual stakeholders to share perspectives and best practices. </p>
		<p><strong>Programs and Projects</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Annual International Conference</strong></p>
		<p>AMIC's annual conference is its flagship program. The conference is the premier learning event on Asian communication media. It attracts eminent international speakers and participants from the communication media industry and academia, and gathers close to 300 academics, media industry professionals, government information officers, policymakers, regulators, independent consultants and students from the Asia Pacific region and all over the world.   </p>
		<p>Each year, AMIC chooses as conference theme, current or emerging communication media issue that needs in-depth examination. For the past decade, conference themes highlight the impact of ICT, communication competencies, Asian values and practices, democracy and governance, freedom of expression and access to information.</p>
		<p>AMIC's annual conference features plenary and parallel sessions. Networking activities, cultural programs, media visits, and even sightseeing events are also arranged in conjunction. The conference provides a platform for presenting new ideas, products, and services.   Members and guests are encouraged to launch their latest publications during the event. Technology companies are invited to present their latest gadgets and apps, and schools, to introduce their new academic programs.</p>
		<p>The annual event is hosted in rotation by countries across the Asia Pacific region. Recent annual conferences have been held in Dubai (2015), Indonesia (2013), Malaysia (2012), India (2011), and Singapore (2010). </p>
		<p><strong>Publications</strong></p>
		<p>AMIC publications are among the most sought-after learning resources by educators, scholars, and practitioners not only in the region but also worldwide. They are distributed by well-known publishing houses including Routledge.</p>
		<p><strong>Academic and Professional Journals</strong></p>
		<p>AMIC is the co-proprietor of the two leading academic and professional journals in the region--Asian Journal of Communication (AJC) and Media Asia. Both are now published by Taylor and Francis, one of the world's leading academic publishers.   The Asian Journal of Communication (AJC) is a joint research publication of AMIC and the Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information  at  Nanyang  Technological  University (WKWSCI-NTU). It is a peer-reviewed  academic  journal that focuses on the systems and processes of communication in the Asia Pacific region and among Asian communities around the world.  AJC is considered the leading communication journal in Asia based on its rejection rate and impact factor. AJC was officially accepted into the Thomson-ISI Social Science Citation Index in Asia in 2008. </p>
		<p>Published since 1974, Media Asia is a profession-oriented journal that shares research-based findings and critical insights addressing contemporary media  issues  and  communication  challenges  in  Asia.  It includes essays and opinion pieces for academics and practitioners to share ideas and help shape the agenda for communication scholarship, practice and policy.</p>
		<p><strong>Books</strong></p>
		<p>Over the years, AMIC has remained steadfast in its mission to  publish books and periodicals on global, regional, and national communication media issues reflective of Asian perspectives, if not universal standards of freedom and democracy. AMIC is the leader in  book development in the Asia Pacific region with over 50 publications produced in the past four decades. AMIC books focus on critical communication and media issues that deal directly with the relationship of communication media with human rights, democracy, governance, gender empowerment, environmental sustainability and health. </p>
		<p>The Asian Communication Handbook is a factual reference for media and communication indicators and recent media developments in Asian countries.   </p>
		<p>AMIC books have been recognized in the prestigious Asian Publishing Awards. </p>
		<p><strong>Research Program</strong></p>
		<p>AMIC's research program is one of the pioneers in the Asia Pacific region. The Centre's research projects highlighted three overall themes – Freedom of Expression (inclusive of Press Freedom);  Asian  Perspectives in  Communication  Structures, Processes,  and  Systems;  and  Role of Communication Media in Development.</p>
		<p>AMIC‘s research projects have diverse importance. The studies enable the Centre to critically examine and situate current and emerging communication media issues from needs and perspective of Asia Pacific countries; generate paradigms and concepts which can feed into Asian communication media theories and models; and produce core content for AMIC's book publishing program.  AMIC's research projects also concretize AMIC's grounding with a variety of grassroots organizations that have supported and participated in AMIC's research studies.</p>
		<p>AMIC's previous research projects have been supported by partners including multilateral development agencies such as the World Bank; UN agencies such as UNESCO, UNDP, UNEP, FAO, UNICEF, WHO, UN and UN ESCAP; national agencies in different Asian governments; academic and learning institutions; and media organizations. AMIC's pioneering partner, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) supported initial research initiatives of the Centre.   </p>
		<p>Before AMIC's s transfer to Manila, AMIC jointly ran the Asian Communication Resource Center (ACRC), a joint project   of   AMIC   and   the   WKWSCI-NTU. The Resource Center, also the repository of AMIC's researches, carried   one   of   Asia's   largest   collections   of   documents   and   audiovisual   materials   on communication.</p>
		<p><strong>AMIC Communication Award</strong></p>
		<p>The AMIC Asia Communication Award was established in 2006 to recognize outstanding achievements of scholars and practitioners in one or several media and communication fields and categories. The contributions of Asia Communication Awardees can be focused on a single country within  Asia,  a  sub‐region  within  Asia,  or  the  whole  of  Asia.  The  Award  is  given  for contributions  to  research,  education,  institution  building,  and  journalism  excellence.     Past awardees include Dr. John Lent, Prof. Eddie C. Y. Kuo, Dr. Nora C.
